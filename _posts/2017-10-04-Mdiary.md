There are something I would like to share to your guys, and here we are. This may be a long-term blog coz I will keep it updated and promise to share what I've learned from my life. So here we go.

## *[You-get](https://tech.hxco.de/you-get/)*

借助 Python 写的一个用来下载各大网站视频的命令行工具

You-get 的 Github Wiki 页上有非常好玩的说明：[You-get 中文说明](https://github.com/soimort/you-get/wiki/%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87%E8%AF%B4%E6%98%8E)

P.S. 挂代理的时候记得添加参数: 

```
-x 127.0.0.1:1080
```

如无挂代理，正常访问即可，不需要加这一行参数。
版本尚未稳定，推荐只用于下载视频，若需下载其他资源，借助 IDM / ARIA2 / WGET / CURL 是更好的选择。

## *[QR-Code](https://github.com/sylnsfar/qrcode/blob/master/README-cn.md)*

Python QR Code Generator: generate common qr-code, artistic qr-code (black & white or colorized), animated qr-code (black & white or colorized).

![img](https://ww1.sinaimg.cn/large/78905b2cgy1fk6db1iprij211j0lbdk5.jpg)*[Website](https://www.amazing-qrcode.com/)*

```bash
myqr    Words
        [-v {1,2,3,...,40}]
        [-l {L,M,Q,H}]
        [-n output-filename]
        [-d output-directory]
        [-p picture_file]
        [-c] # colorize picture
        [-con contrast]
        [-bri brightness]
```

最终效果：

## *[3Blue1Brown][3b1b]*

This is a series of videos using dynamic figures to help us understanding many mathematic theories.

Recently I am studing Modern Control, which involved linear algebra a lot, and it reminds me of these videos.

The video maker used python to make much of his videos, and believe me. Once you open these videos, you will love them, especially when you need them.

Yes, obviously it is in Chinese, check the Google translate if you like.

Actually, for a full vision of this blog, I highly recommend [this article][this-article] concerning about the reason why the author choose to read more but not watch videos.

I think the author shares an idea that reading works much better for motivated information absorbing.

I cannot agree more with the blogger coz from another perspective, it works as well that we shall pick up our spare time to read instead of being only follow the step of those video-makers, without our own inspiration.

The blog also reminds me of one of the main characters of a Japanese novel, which called [Hyoka][Hyoka], or Classic Literature Club written by Honobu Yonezawa.

The main protagonist, Oreki Hotaro, keeps a habit of reading and does not disturb himself with electronic devices, which helps a lot, I think, in his brilliant logical deductions.
